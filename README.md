## Product Update Propagator
This is a system for consuming product updates from a source system
Events are generated by Change Data Capture on an underlying DB. This POC generates dummy events based on the current timestamp and a monotonic clock
Depending on the event type the event is transformed and written into different topics
Consumers can listen to one or more topics that may be relevant to them

## How to use
1. Install and run a kafka pipeline using the following docs -> https://kafka.apache.org/quickstart
2. Clone the repo
3. Install requirements 
    ```
    pip install requirements.txt
    ```
4. Create 2 topics with names -> PRODUCT_PRICE, COUNTRY_DISCOUNT
5. Use docs in point 1 above to watch events flow in the correct topic
