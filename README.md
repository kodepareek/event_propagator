## Product Update Propagator
This is a system for consuming product updates from a source system
Events are generated by Change Data Capture on an underlying DB. This POC generates dummy events based on the current timestamp and a monotonic clock
Depending on the event type the event is transformed and written into different topics
Consumers can listen to one or more topics that may be relevant to them
